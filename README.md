# Analyzing Stocks Using the Moving Average Crossover Strategy
Our repo is to show viewers how our project works, and the base code that was used to to create it. We will show others how we created our code that shows how stocks change over time through data visualizations, and we will present our findings on the Moving Average Crossover technique. 

## Overview
Our projects purpose is to select popular stocks from yahoo finance and accurately represent the data collected in a way that makes it easier to understand, and use the Moving Average Crossover technique to provide stock price trends. Our goal is to explain the data in a way that makes the reader understand the visuals of the overall stock and use the Moving Average Crossover technique to predict stock price trends. 

## Interesting Insight:

Here we can see an rough outline of how our moving average crossover would look like on a graph

## Current Plan
Each members will write code using data about stock from the website and apply the moving average crossover to it. They will also make 2 tables and 1 graph that goes acordingly with it. Finally they should conclude their findings through the QMD file.
